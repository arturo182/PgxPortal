What is this?
------------
This is my old (2005) and first PHP script. It's a functional CMS with news, download, gallery, forums etc. 
It was written in two weeks on a bet.

Installation
------------
Are you crazy?! It's full of security holes and makes you turn register_globals on to work!
The code has almost no indentation, you have been warned. I will not pay for your eye surgery.

Why?
------------
Because it's a part of me, my first adventure with PHP and it shows how long a way I came.
I don't want it to be forgotten, neither to be remembered too much.

Fun fact: It was written completely in Windows Notepad.
